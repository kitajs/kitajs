<br />
<br />

Kita is a semi-opinionated fastify based typescript framework without runtime bloat
using code generation. It generates OpenAPI compliant routes, only requires functional
programming patterns, is 100% testable and supports all the usual features of fastify.

<br />

> This framework is being slowly built because one of the main goals is developer
> experience, so the API design is being carefully designed and tested by other
> developers. A fast and lightweight architecture is also one of many initial
> requirements.
